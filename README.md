# Hi! Welcome to My Page!
My name is Leo Ke. I am a high school junior aspiring to become an A.I. devloper. I find the entire concept of A.I. to be very interesting and it is a tool that can be used for efficiency. However, I don't like the ethical and moral implications of A.I. image generation and the use of A.I. generated articles and journaling. I'm hoping I can make at least a small impact to make A.I. more ethical.

# My Experience
As a high school student, I don't have much experience right now. I have a basic understanding of python, react, css, pandas, and matplotlib, but I'm hoping to expand this more with C# in the near future. I have some projects I'm working on at home like making my own A.I. (it's very bad, but it's something) and going through some HacktheBox courses.

# Projects
I don't have very many projects I'm really proud of, but there is a data repository that I helped create that was for NASA HUNCH. We didn't qualify to go to Houston to present to real NASA engineers, however what we have is still something I'm proud of. Here's the website: https://bit-store-d48f7.web.app/ and here's the repository: https://github.com/VoidedCrystal/Bit-Store-Nasa-Hunch
